# Vim
1. Pairing a command with `Shift` (or the capital letter version) usually means applying the action until the end of the line. So `Shift+D` deletes from the current cursor until the end of the line.

2. To indent **all the code**, use `gg=G`. Then all lines will be indented according to a specific style.

3. To comment multiple lines of code
    1. Press `CTRL + Q` (on Windows) or `CTRL + V` (On Linux) to enter the `VISUAL BLOCK` Mode.
    2. Type `SHIFT-I` to insert in `VISUAL BLOCK` Mode. To comment, type `//` and then `ESC` to go back to Normal Mode  . Then the text `//` will be inserted in front of each line selected.
    3. To uncomment, select `//` on each line that you wish to uncomment, and `x` to delete them.
