# Vim
1. Pairing a command with `Shift` (or the capital letter version) usually means applying the action until the end of the line. So `Shift+D` deletes from the current cursor until the end of the line.

## Reformatting
1. To indent **all the code**, use `gg=G`. Then all lines will be indented according to a specific style.

## Commenting Multiple Lines of Code
1. Press `CTRL + Q` (on Windows) or `CTRL + V` (On Linux) to enter the `VISUAL BLOCK` Mode.
2. Type `SHIFT-I` to insert in `VISUAL BLOCK` Mode. To comment, type `//` and then `ESC` to go back to Normal Mode  . Then the text `//` will be inserted in front of each line selected.
3. To uncomment, select `//` on each line that you wish to uncomment, and `x` to delete them.

## Changing Names
### Changing the name of one type/variable/method call
Occasionally, we mix up our variable or our method name, and we need to fix it before the code runs correctly or compiles. Suppose we have
```
double perimeter = get_area();
```
and we realize that we should be calling `get_perimeter` instead. Instead of using backspace or delete to delete the characters one by one, we can use `cw` to change the word `get_area` into `get_perimeter`.

To do so, (i) place the cursor at the beginning of `get_area`. Remember to avoid using arrow keys or `h` or `l` to move letter-by-letter. You can use `w` or `b` for faster word-by-word navigation. (ii) type `cw` to remove the word `get_area` and enter INSERT mode. Now type `get_perimeter` to replace the method name and ESC to return back to NORMAL mode.

> Basically, the command we should memorize here is using `cw` to change one word.
