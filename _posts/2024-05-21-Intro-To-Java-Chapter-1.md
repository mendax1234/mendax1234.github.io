# Chapter 1: Introduction to Computers, Programs, and Java
## 1.1 - 1.5
This part is too easy so there is not so much to mention.

## 1.6 The Java Language Specification, API, JDK, JRE, and IDE
1. The **Java language specification** is a technical definition of the Java programming language's syntax and semantics.
2. The **application program interface (API)**, also known as *library*, contains predefined classes and interfaces for developing Java programs.The API is still expanding.
3. Java SE, Java EE and ME
    - *Java Standard Edition* a.k.a Java SE.
    - *Java Enterprise Edition* a.k.a Java EE.
    - *Java Micro Edition* a.k.a Java ME.
4. The **Java Development Kit (JDK)**, consists of a set of separate **programs**, each invoked from a command line, for **compiling, running and testing Java programs**.
    - The **program for running Java programs** is known as **JRE (Java Runtime Environment)**. Instead of using JDK directly, you can use some other development tools (Eclipse etc) that provide an *integrated development environment (IDE)*.
    - In this book, we will use Java SE 8. And Oracle releases each version of Java SE with a *JDK*. For Java SE 8, the JDK is called *JDK 1.8* (a.k.a *Java 8* or *JDK 8*).
