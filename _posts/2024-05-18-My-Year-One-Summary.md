The first semester in Year 1 for Comp Eng students at NTU is not that stressed. It's likely that you have much free time to do things you like.

## CC0003 Ethics & Civics in a Multicultural World
**Grade: A**
1. For the panel discussion, or the "debate", to be honest, I am not good at that. One suggestion is that you can consult the [LCC](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/lcc) to improve you content or presentation.
2. For the class participation, the criteria may be different between different tutors. For my tutor, there is a function called "dicussion" on the NTULearn. So, if you don't want to answer the questions in class, you can also answer the questions in the "discussion" section to earn the class part. I guess this is also the reason I get **high** at the end of this sem.
3. For the poster, I also recommend you booking appointments at [LCC](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/lcc).
4. For the MCQ Test, since it's open-book, find a good reference from your senior. I remember that someone's material is very useful.

## CC0005 Healthy Living & Wellbeing
**Grade: B+**
1. For the two parts' presentation, I don't have so much advice. Hope that your group member is okie. And again, [LCC](https://www.mtu.edu.sg/lcc) will be useful.
2. For the Final Assignment, which is about a change you have achieved during this sem. I also don't have much advice.

## EG1001 Engineers in Society
**Grade: A-**
1. For the lecture, since it usually falls on Wednesday morning, I personally think you don't need to go if you don't want to. But this doesn't mean the lecture slides are useless. Actually, most of the content will be included in the MCQ test.
2. For the MCQ, which will mainly based on the lectures. I don't have much advice. But notice that it's closed-book and online test. Atb.
3. For the tutorial:
    1. The presentation: My presentation is about Bitcoin and thanks to my previous research done in the related field, this topic is easy for me to present. But there is another very interesting topic, which is about famous engineers and among them has **Dean Kamen**, the founder of FRC. For advice on how to do your presentation, I would stronlg recommend you learn from other ppl in your class, try to see what comments your tutor gives to them and then you will get a rough idea about what structure and way of presenting your tutor likes.
    2. The class participation: If you know the topic for presentation in advance, you can prepare some questions in advance. That will be useful.

## SC1013 Physics for Computing
**Grade: P(ass)**
1. For the first four weeks, we take class from Prof Ho. I would say if you take PRC GaoKao, they are all about high school physics. But to be honest, Prof Ho is very good!
2. For the second half, this course becomes useless.

## SC1003 Introduction to Computational Thinking & Programming
**Grade: A+**
1. Python: As an introduction course, there is not so much difficulty. But if you want to understand more. I would recommend the book *[Python Crash Course](https://ehmatthes.github.io/pcc_3e/)*.

2. C: Also as an intruduction course, algorithms are seldom covered. But if you want to get a deeper understanding of C, I would stronly recommend you reading this book: *[C Programming: A Modern Approach](http://knking.com/books/c2/)*. It is very good for you to understand some concepts like pointers in C.a

## SC1005 Digital Logic
**Grade: A+** \
As a foundamental core course, this course is very important if you want to learn more about computer hardware, like computer architecture. Many books will take digital logic as the very first course before they start talking about the computer architecture. So, it's very important.
1. For this course, I strongly recommend you reading the textbook: [Fundamentals of Digital Logic with Verilog Design](https://www.mheducation.com/highered/product/fundamentals-digital-logic-verilog-design-brown-vranesic/M9780073380544.html). This book is written so well that it can be either served as a book for preview or get a deeper understanding about Digital Logic and Verilog.

2. Another book I refer to is the [Digital Fundamentals](https://www.amazon.com/Digital-Fundamentals-11th-Thomas-Floyd/dp/0132737965). I remember that this book is also quite good for you to understand the concepts deeply.

3. For the first half of this course, the tutor has provided us a free online book, I think it is worth reading but I personally think the two books above are better.

## MH1810 Mathematics 1
**Grade: A+** \
Math 1 is not difficult for those who take PRC GaoKao to get into NTU, so my advice here may not be suitable for others. But I still think the textbook is very very helpful for this course.
1. I stronly recommend you reading the textbook: [Calculus: Early Transcendentals](https://www.amazon.com/Calculus-Early-Transcendentals-Metric-Edition/dp/0357113519).
