Welcome to CS50! This is my review for Week 8's content about HTML, CSS and Javascript.

# Lecture
Nothing much to note down since it's a really big topic. The best note from lecture is to practice I think.

# Section
1. CSS
    - The general structure
    ```css
    selector {
        property: value;
        property: value;
    }
    ```
    - The `id` selector
    ```css
    #id {
        property: value;
    }
    ```
        To use it, you need to specify the `id="id_name"` in the html code.
    - The `tag` selector
    ```css
    tag {
        property: value;
    }
    ```
    - The `class` selectr
    ```css
    .class {
        property: value;
    }
    ```
        To use it, you need to speficyf the `class="class_name"` in the html code.
